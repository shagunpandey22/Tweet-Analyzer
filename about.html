            Sentiment analysis, also refers as opinion mining, is a sub machine learning task where
            we want to determine which is the general sentiment of a given document. <br><br>Using machine
            learning techniques and natural language processing we can extract the subjective information
            of a document and try to classify it according to its polarity such as positive, neutral or negative.
            <br><br>
            It is a really useful analysis since we could possibly determine the overall opinion about a selling
            objects, or predict stock markets for a given company like, if most people think positive about it,
            possibly its stock markets will increase, and so on.
            <br><br> Sentiment analysis is actually far from to be
            solved since the language is very complex (objectivity/subjectivity, negation, vocabulary,
            grammar,...) but it is also why it is very interesting to working on.
